# Typesense-orm
This is an ORM client for typesense-server. It is still under construction (now only write operations work)
### Installation

### Description
This client has aiohttp under the hood, but you can specify a mode (see example) and work in either a synchronized manner, or in an async mode.<br/>
The ORM is based on pydantic here (actually models are inherited from pydantic base model with some methods overriden). (to be continued)
